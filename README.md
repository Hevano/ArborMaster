# ArborMaster

ArborMaster is a tool to help game developers implement, test, and iterate on behaviour trees. Firstly, the node-based visual designer allows developers to craft behaviour trees from nodes they have implemented with a drag and drop interface.

In addition to the tool’s designing capability, the debugging feature links into the game at runtime to visually display the status of behaviour trees on selected AI actors, as well as the state of data within the behaviour tree’s blackboard. This tool is implementation-agnostic, supporting C++ projects that do not use a preexisting engine or behaviour tree implementation library.
